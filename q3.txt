Prompt:
If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

Response:
Python, for the past year, has been my favorite language.
On my local environment, I use Python 3.8, but for sharing and documenting my code (especially Machine Learning and AI) I use Google Colab, which is currently on Python 3.7.
I often use assignment expressions (PEP 572) on my local environment, but since these are new to Python 3.8, I have to re-write my code whenever I want to share it on Google Colab.
So, I would like to see Google Colab upgraded to Python 3.8 (or latest).

Example use cases of assignment expressions:

# Return x if a method call returns True
if x := isBig(y):
    return x

# Handle a matched regex
if (match := pattern.search(data)) is not None:
    # Do something with match

# A loop that can't be trivially rewritten using 2-arg iter()
while chunk := file.read(8192):
   process(chunk)

# Reuse a value that's expensive to compute
[y := f(x), y**2, y**3]

# Share a subexpression between a comprehension filter clause and its output
filtered_data = [y for x in data if (y := f(x)) is not None]
